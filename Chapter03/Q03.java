//cramers rule
//(Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
//ax+by=e cx + dy = f
// x = ed - bf / ad - bc y = af - ec / ad - bc
//Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y : 3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
//2.1x + .55y = 5.9
